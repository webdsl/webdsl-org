---------------------------------------------------------

* Fix menus
* Improve "submit issue" interface (there's no names for each field)
* Remove "conversation test" from home
* Posting replies does not seem to work properly (my reply was posted 3 times)
* How can I create a new blog? I can make new posts, but how about
blogs? Also, terminology is confusing, should be clear distinction
between a Blog and a Blog post.

General WebDSL Issues
---------------------

- backing into edit screen causes crash on subsequent save
- ordered lists; lists tend to lose ordering, e.g. author list


Interaction Patterns
--------------------

- creating new objects (especially objects with a symbolic id)
  - wiki page
  - issue
  - blog entry and comments
  - registering new users

Navigation
----------

- entry points
  - home page of complete app
  - start pages for sub-apps (e.g. issues)
  - need to identify recently added objects, important
    objects, etc.
- how to organize navigation between sub-applications

- examples
  - start pages of a wiki
  - road map for issue tracker

Wiki
----

x edit history
- categories
- tags
- name should be read-only
- add title to override reference
- start pages should be shown on wiki front-page
- name spaces: foo/bar already works
  - it should be possible to use this notion in access control,
    e.g. owner of foo owns all foo/* pages

Issues
------

- key should be read-only
- themes and releases to organize views on 
  collections of issues


Tags
----

- generic mechanism for categorizing content (objects)
- should be possible to add tags by name, but also
  select tags from (user's) collection
