General WebDSL Issues
---------------------

- backing into edit screen causes crash on subsequent save
- ordered lists; lists tend to lose ordering, e.g. author list


Interaction Patterns
--------------------

- creating new objects (especially objects with a symbolic id)
  - wiki page
  - issue
  - blog entry and comments
  - registering new users

Navigation
----------

- entry points
  - home page of complete app
  - start pages for sub-apps (e.g. issues)
  - need to identify recently added objects, important
    objects, etc.
- how to organize navigation between sub-applications

- examples
  - start pages of a wiki
  - road map for issue tracker

Wiki
----

- edit history
- categories
- tags
- name should be read-only
- add title to override reference
- start pages should be shown on wiki front-page
- name spaces: foo/bar already works
  - it should be possible to use this notion in access control,
    e.g. owner of foo owns all foo/* pages

Issues
------

- key should be read-only
- themes and releases to organize views on 
  collections of issues


Tags
----

- generic mechanism for categorizing content (objects)
- should be possible to add tags by name, but also
  select tags from (user's) collection
