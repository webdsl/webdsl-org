General WebDSL Issues
---------------------

- backing into edit screen causes crash on subsequent save
- ordered lists; lists tend to lose ordering, e.g. author list
- fix drop-down menus
- unselect all issues in a many select box
- rendering lists with separators (e.g. authors separated by commas)

Interaction Patterns
--------------------

- creating new objects (especially objects with a symbolic id)
  x wiki page
  x issue
  - blog entry and comments
  - registering new users

Navigation
----------

- entry points
  x home page of complete app
  x start pages for sub-apps (e.g. issues)
  - need to identify recently added objects, important
    objects, etc.

x how to organize navigation between sub-applications
  -> menubar to switch between applications
  -> wiki links in WikiText provide fine grained navigation

- examples
  x start pages of a wiki
  - road map for issue tracker

Authentication
--------------

- change password

Wiki
----

x edit history
- categories
- tags
x name should be read-only
x add title to override reference
x start pages should be shown on wiki front-page
- name spaces: foo/bar already works
  - it should be possible to use this notion in access control,
    e.g. owner of foo owns all foo/* pages

- in diff page, visualize the differences

Issues
------

- themes and releases 
  x to organize views on collections of issues
  
- editProject
  - custom page
  - key should be read-only
  - nextkey should be read-only

- editIssue
  - custom page
  - select requires / requiredby from issues in project
  x include title in select menu (i.e. in name?)

x Improve "submit issue" interface (there's no names for each field)

- filters on issues
  - all open issues
  - issues by assignee, by reporter
  - older than x days
  - by theme
  - by release
  - by priority
  - by due date
  - ...

- find conflicts between issues
  - based on dependencies and due dates
  - derive necessary due dates
  - propagate due dates along requires relation

- roadmap

- from issue tracking to workflow
  - workflow is repeatable tree of dependent issues

Blog
----

- How can I create a new blog? I can make new posts, but how about
blogs? Also, terminology is confusing, should be clear distinction
between a Blog and a Blog post.

Forum
-----

- discussion threads
- adding replies 
- Posting replies does not seem to work properly 
  (my reply was posted 3 times)

News
----

- news items
- show most n recent items

FAQ
---

- finding questions

Tags
----

- generic mechanism for categorizing content (objects)
- should be possible to add tags by name, but also
  select tags from (user's) collection
